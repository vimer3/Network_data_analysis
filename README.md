# 🕵️ Terrorist Organization Network Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the structure of terrorist organizations using network analysis techniques. 🌐🔍

🔑 **Key Components**:

1️⃣ **Data Preparation and Network Visualization: **📊
We load and visualize the terrorist network, examining its basic properties such as number of nodes and edges.

2️⃣ **Network Metrics and Decomposition:** 🧮
We analyze degree distribution, transitivity, and decompose the network into subgraphs to identify distinct organizational structures.

3️⃣ **Centrality Measures:** 🎯
We employ betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality to identify key figures in the network, such as "linkers" and "propagators".

4️⃣ **Community Detection:** 🔬
We apply Stochastic Block Models and clustering algorithms to detect communities within the network.

5️⃣** Structural Analysis:** 🏗️
We identify and analyze three main organizational structures: Chain, Star or Hub, and All-Channel networks.
